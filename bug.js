```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href='/about'>
        <a>About Us</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
This component uses the `next/link` component, which is a common way to navigate in Next.js.  However, if the route '/about' does not exist, the user will see a 404 error.  In Next.js 15, this might not be handled gracefully in all cases, leading to unexpected behavior or silent failures depending on your app's configuration.  The problem is subtle and might not show up immediately in development mode.
